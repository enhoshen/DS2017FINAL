Bike Sharing System User Number Prediction

## [Abstract](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aSSCUY7zKjgmx_NfynuDGJAoMsRLy9DFm6jmIgi4F74/edit#)
## Datasets
* [Bicycle Trip Data from Seattle's Cycle Share System](https://www.kaggle.com/pronto/cycle-share-dataset/data) with weather info
* [SF Bay Area Bike Share](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/sf-bay-area-bike-share/data) without user attributes but subscriber or not

## Goal  
* Given station distance and weather information  --> predict the user number at the station
* Given trip ids and weather information --> predict the best distance  between each station
* Finding the attributes which affect the user number the most.
